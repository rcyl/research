Start by creating a new folder for your work with an appropriate name.

Create a NOTES.md file in that folder and append notes to it as you work, tracking what you tried and anything you learned along the way.

Create a dockerfile with a debian:bookworm image to track any dependencies you need to add. 

If you are given a weblink, download all the docs and convert them in markdown format under a docs folder. 

Build a README.md report at the end of the investigation. 

For all the steps detailed in README.md, you MUST run them first to make sure it works.
